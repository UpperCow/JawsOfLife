					<p>[Verse 1]<br>
					Barney is a dinosaur from our imagination<br>
					And when he's tall<br>
					He's what we call a dinosaur sensation<br></p>
					<p>[Verse 2]<br>
					Barney's friends are big and small<br>
					They come from lots of places<br>
					After school they meet to play<br>
					And sing with happy faces<br></p>
					<p>[Verse 3]<br>
					Barney shows us lots of things<br>
					Like how to play pretend<br>
					ABC's, and 123's<br>
					And how to be a friend<br></p>
					<p>[Verse 4]<br>
					Barney comes to play with us<br>
					Whenever we may need him<br>
					Barney can be your friend too<br>
					If you just make-believe him!<br></p>
